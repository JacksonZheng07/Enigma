THE RECOVER PROJECT SEEKS TO RESTORE, STABILIZE, AND REINFORCE FOOD SECURITY AND INCOMES DISRUPTED BY THE MID-SEASON LONG DRY SPELL EXPERIENCED IN THE 2017/18 AGRICULTURE SEASON. THE PROJECT WILL TARGET VULNERABLE, DRY SPELL AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS, INCLUDING THOSE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES, IN BULILIMS, GWANDA, MANGWE, AND MATOBO DISTRICTS. CURRENTLY, CRS IS IMPLEMENTING THE OFDA-FUNDED ZIMBABWE EL NINO RELIEF SOUTH (ZEN) II PROJECT IN BULILIMA, GWANDA, INSIZA, AND UMZINGWANE DISTRICTS. CRS PROPOSES TO PHASE OUT OF UMZINGWANE AND INSIZA DISTRICTS IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER OFF IN TERMS OF FOOD AND INCOME SECURITY AS COMPARED TO MATOBO AND MANGWE. UMZINGWANE AND INSIZA HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED UNDER IPC PHASE 2 (STRESSED) AS COMPARED TO THE NEW PROPOSED DISTRICTS WHICH ARE AT IPC LEVEL 3. CRS SEEKS TO ENSURE FOOD AND INCOME SECURITY RECOVERY, WHICH WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH 2 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES: (1) FOOD SMART AGRICULTURE AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION; AND (2) VULNERABLE HHS HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO SAVINGS AND LOANS. THE PROJECT WILL PROMOTE THE USE OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES/TECHNOLOGIES, INCREASE KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS TO SHOCKS AND STRESSES, AND INCREASE ACCESS TO DISPOSABLE INCOME THROUGH CRS' SAVINGS AND INTERNAL LENDING COMMUNITIES (SILC) METHODOLOGY. THE PROJECT WILL BUILD ON 2 YEARS OF LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE ZEN AND ZEN II PROJECTS WHERE SILC, DROUGHT TOLERANT CROPS, SMALL STOCK, EXTENSION AND EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WERE CITED AS KEY DRIVERS OF COMMUNITY RECOVERY."

ZIMBABWEANS REMAIN LARGELY A RURAL PEOPLE WHO DERIVE THEIR LIVELIHOOD FROM AGRICULTURE AND OTHER RELATED RURAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. ACCORDING TO THE FOOD AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION, IT PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME FOR 60-70 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION. \r\nTHE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING DOMESTIC AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, THE IMPACT OF POVERTY AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ON ACCESS TO FOOD AND BASIC SERVICES, ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS SUCH AS DROUGHT/FLOODING, RELATED SHIFTING CLIMATE PATTERNS AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS RELATED TO HIV AND MIGRATION. \r\nIN RESPONSE TO THE EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O-INDUCED DROUGHT DURING THE 2015/2016 CROPPING SEASON, CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS) PARTNERED WITH ADRA AND CARITAS BULAWAYO TO IMPLEMENT THE 12-MONTH ZIMBABWE EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O RELIEF SOUTH PROJECT (ZEN). THIS PROJECT IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN JULY 2017. THE PROJECT TARGETS THE DISTRICTS OF GWANDA, UMZINGWANE, INSIZA AND BULILIMA IN MATABELELAND SOUTH PROVINCE. \r\nIN FEBRUARY 2017, TROPICAL STORM DINEO HIT ZIMBABWE CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHILE EXCESSIVE RAINS HAMPERED CURRENT RECOVERY EFFORTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, MANY AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE UNABLE TO REALIZE FULL RECOVERY DURING THE 2016/2017 CROPPING SEASON. WHILE MANY FAMILIES RECEIVED SOME RELIEF FOLLOWING THESE SHOCKS, CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HELP FAMILIES RECOVER FROM THE DROUGHT AND SUBSEQUENT HEAVY RAINS/FLOODING WILL ALLOW VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS TO RESTORE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.\r\nCRS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CARITAS BULAWAYO AND ADRA IS PLEASED TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL FOR A SECOND PHASE OF THE ZIMBABWE EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O RELIEF PROJECT (ZEN II). THIS WILL ENABLE THE CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF COMMUNITY AND DISTRICT CAPACITIES TO PREPARE FOR AND MITIGATE THE HAZARDS OF CLIMATE VARIATION BY FURTHER DEVELOPING A CULTURE OF RISK AWARENESS, ASSESSMENT AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING. THIS APPROACH WILL BE COUPLED WITH ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS TO LIVELIHOODS PROTECTION SYSTEMS AND ENHANCED TRAINING AND SUPPORT ON IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES TO INCREASE RESILIENCE TO EXTREME WEATHER VARIABILITY IN FLOOD IMPACTED AREAS.\r\nTHE ZEN II PROPOSED PACKAGE OF INTERVENTIONS WILL LEVERAGE THE INITIAL RECOVERY EFFORTS UNDER ZEN AND INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED AND FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ZEN II WILL IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURE RECOVERY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON AGRICULTURAL INPUTS PROVISION; FODDER PRODUCTION AND FODDER SEED MULTIPLICATION; FODDER MARKET LINKAGES; IMPROVED LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT; POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES; FARM-LEVEL NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; AND INCREASING ACCESS TO RURAL MICRO-FINANCE SUPPORT. VULNERABLE FARMING HOUSEHOLDS, ALREADY IMPACTED BY EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O, AND FURTHER AFFECTED BY TROPICAL STORM DINEO, WILL BE SUPPORTED TO FULLY RECOVER, PREPARE FOR THE 2017/18 AGRICULTURE SEASON, AND BUILD LONG-TERM RESILIENCE THROUGH ADDRESSING BOTH HOUSEHOLD AND COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS.

CRS PROPOSES TO PHASE OUT OF UMZINGWANE AND INSIZA DISTRICTS IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER OFF IN TERMS OF FOOD AND INCOME SECURITY AS COMPARED TO MATOBO AND MANGWE. UMZINGWANE AND INSIZA HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED UNDER IPC PHASE 2 (STRESSED) AS COMPARED TO THE NEW PROPOSED DISTRICTS WHICH ARE AT IPC LEVEL 3. CRS SEEKS TO ENSURE FOOD AND INCOME SECURITY RECOVERY, WHICH WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH 2 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES: (1) FOOD SMART AGRICULTURE AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION; AND (2) VULNERABLE HHS HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO SAVINGS AND LOANS. THE PROJECT WILL PROMOTE THE USE OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES/TECHNOLOGIES, INCREASE KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS TO SHOCKS AND STRESSES, AND INCREASE ACCESS TO DISPOSABLE INCOME THROUGH CRS' SAVINGS AND INTERNAL LENDING COMMUNITIES (SILC) METHODOLOGY.

ZIMBABWEANS REMAIN LARGELY A RURAL PEOPLE WHO DERIVE THEIR LIVELIHOOD FROM AGRICULTURE AND OTHER RELATED RURAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. ACCORDING TO THE FOOD AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION, IT PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME FOR 60-70 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION. \r\nTHE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING DOMESTIC AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, THE IMPACT OF POVERTY AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ON ACCESS TO FOOD AND BASIC SERVICES, ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS SUCH AS DROUGHT/FLOODING, RELATED SHIFTING CLIMATE PATTERNS AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS RELATED TO HIV AND MIGRATION. \r\nIN RESPONSE TO THE EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O-INDUCED DROUGHT DURING THE 2015/2016 CROPPING SEASON, CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS) PARTNERED WITH ADRA AND CARITAS BULAWAYO TO IMPLEMENT THE 12-MONTH ZIMBABWE EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O RELIEF SOUTH PROJECT (ZEN). THIS PROJECT IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN JULY 2017. THE PROJECT TARGETS THE DISTRICTS OF GWANDA, UMZINGWANE, INSIZA AND BULILIMA IN MATABELELAND SOUTH PROVINCE. \r\nIN FEBRUARY 2017, TROPICAL STORM DINEO HIT ZIMBABWE CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHILE EXCESSIVE RAINS HAMPERED CURRENT RECOVERY EFFORTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, MANY AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE UNABLE TO REALIZE FULL RECOVERY DURING THE 2016/2017 CROPPING SEASON. WHILE MANY FAMILIES RECEIVED SOME RELIEF FOLLOWING THESE SHOCKS, CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HELP FAMILIES RECOVER FROM THE DROUGHT AND SUBSEQUENT HEAVY RAINS/FLOODING WILL ALLOW VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS TO RESTORE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.\r\nCRS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CARITAS BULAWAYO AND ADRA IS PLEASED TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL FOR A SECOND PHASE OF THE ZIMBABWE EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O RELIEF PROJECT (ZEN II). THIS WILL ENABLE THE CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF COMMUNITY AND DISTRICT CAPACITIES TO PREPARE FOR AND MITIGATE THE HAZARDS OF CLIMATE VARIATION BY FURTHER DEVELOPING A CULTURE OF RISK AWARENESS, ASSESSMENT AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING. THIS APPROACH WILL BE COUPLED WITH ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS TO LIVELIHOODS PROTECTION SYSTEMS AND ENHANCED TRAINING AND SUPPORT ON IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES TO INCREASE RESILIENCE TO EXTREME WEATHER VARIABILITY IN FLOOD IMPACTED AREAS.\r\nTHE ZEN II PROPOSED PACKAGE OF INTERVENTIONS WILL LEVERAGE THE INITIAL RECOVERY EFFORTS UNDER ZEN AND INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED AND FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ZEN II WILL IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURE RECOVERY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON AGRICULTURAL INPUTS PROVISION; FODDER PRODUCTION AND FODDER SEED MULTIPLICATION; FODDER MARKET LINKAGES; IMPROVED LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT; POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES; FARM-LEVEL NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; AND INCREASING ACCESS TO RURAL MICRO-FINANCE SUPPORT. VULNERABLE FARMING HOUSEHOLDS, ALREADY IMPACTED BY EL NI\u00c3\u0191\u00c2\u00b1O, AND FURTHER AFFECTED BY TROPICAL STORM DINEO, WILL BE SUPPORTED TO FULLY RECOVER, PREPARE FOR THE 2017/18 AGRICULTURE SEASON, AND BUILD LONG-TERM RESILIENCE THROUGH ADDRESSING BOTH HOUSEHOLD AND COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS.

THE PROJECT WILL TARGET VULNERABLE, DRY SPELL AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS, INCLUDING THOSE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES, IN BULILIMS, GWANDA, MANGWE, AND MATOBO DISTRICTS. CURRENTLY, CRS IS IMPLEMENTING THE OFDA-FUNDED ZIMBABWE EL NINO RELIEF SOUTH (ZEN) II PROJECT IN BULILIMA, GWANDA, INSIZA, AND UMZINGWANE DISTRICTS. CRS PROPOSES TO PHASE OUT OF UMZINGWANE AND INSIZA DISTRICTS IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER OFF IN TERMS OF FOOD AND INCOME SECURITY AS COMPARED TO MATOBO AND MANGWE. UMZINGWANE AND INSIZA HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED UNDER IPC PHASE 2 (STRESSED) AS COMPARED TO THE NEW PROPOSED DISTRICTS WHICH ARE AT IPC LEVEL 3. CRS SEEKS TO ENSURE FOOD AND INCOME SECURITY RECOVERY, WHICH WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH 2 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES: (1) FOOD SMART AGRICULTURE AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION; AND (2) VULNERABLE HHS HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO SAVINGS AND LOANS. THE PROJECT WILL PROMOTE THE USE OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES/TECHNOLOGIES, INCREASE KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS TO SHOCKS AND STRESSES, AND INCREASE ACCESS TO DISPOSABLE INCOME THROUGH CRS' SAVINGS AND INTERNAL LENDING COMMUNITIES (SILC) METHODOLOGY. THE PROJECT WILL BUILD ON 2 YEARS OF LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE ZEN AND ZEN II PROJECTS WHERE SILC, DROUGHT TOLERANT CROPS, SMALL STOCK, EXTENSION AND EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WERE CITED AS KEY DRIVERS OF COMMUNITY RECOVERY."
